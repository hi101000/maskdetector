# maskdetector
use to detect masks.
you can use this project to detect if someone is using a mask or not.
If you are using this for a store, modify as needed and in the end it should lock the doors for 2 minutes i the person is not wearing a mask.
I cannot give specific directions because most stores have different systems for the doors.
Use the maskfinder.tm file on teachable machine to refine the model to any desired accuracy.
